<ul>
  <li>Lists</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Tables</li>
  <li>Code blocks</li>
  <li>Horizonal Lines</li>
  <li>Definition Lists</li>
  <li>Math</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s probably more that I will eventually realise I need, in which case I will just update this document and have a go at styling them. The first element, a list, is already above.</p>

<p>The point of reference for the elements that I will be using is <a href="&quot;https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html&quot;">kramdown</a>, a Ruby library for parsing and converting a superset of Markdown. There is quite a bit of detail to it and I’m still learning, such is the process.</p>

<p>Images are also already taken care of, I just need to put them in HTML code instead of</p>

<h2 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h2>

<p>Instead of trying to figure out a solution on my own I am using <a href="&quot;https://highlightjs.org/&quot;">highligh.js</a>, which seems to be very convenient and just works right out of the box.</p>

<p><strong>Put a before and after here</strong></p>
