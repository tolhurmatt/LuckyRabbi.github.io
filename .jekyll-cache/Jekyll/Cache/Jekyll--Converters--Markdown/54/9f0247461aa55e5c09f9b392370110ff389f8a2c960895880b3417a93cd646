I"Å<p>Being uncomfortable is a deeply unnatural state, it runs counter to our biological mechanisms that maintain a dynamic equilibrium. Being nervous is a result of this discomfort, it arises like a larvae from its cocoon. It is precisely this nervousness that I am trying to embrace, it means that I give a shit, that I am invested in the work I do, the friends I make and the person I want to become.</p>

<p>If I am to improve as I would like to, I must force myslef to let the discomfort and nervousness become a part of my waking reality. I ought to use it as a guide and not deter me. If I am nervous and uncormfortable I should revel in the fact that I am very likely heading in the right direction.</p>
