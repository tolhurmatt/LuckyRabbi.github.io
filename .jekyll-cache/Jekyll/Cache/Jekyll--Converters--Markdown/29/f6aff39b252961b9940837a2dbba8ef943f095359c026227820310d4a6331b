<p>A boy walked into the rain, feeling overwhelmed by the bedlam of the places heâ€™s been that day. The rain reminded him that eventually everything will be washed away. Any sense of permanence is a falsehood, the concrete that steadied the steps of countless wandering minds will one day be gone and the minds themselves forgotten too.</p>

<p>It was a ritual of cleansing, an act of necessity, as though his mind had been filled with rubble; he knew that as the rain danced across his face a flood would gently lift the remnants of the day and carry them away.</p>

<p>He knew that the rain would eventually stop, the water would settle and seep to be taken away again; he was calm, content and clean. His life would matter, his mind would scatter and fray and when it did, heâ€™d do a little rain dance and the rain would come again and wash it all away.</p>
