I"*%<h1 id="im-online-therefore-i-exist">I’m online, therefore I exist</h1>

<p>This adage is a bit tongue-in-cheek but I think the sentiment is genuine. Much of the interesting work that I want to do involves some computational or digital component, and so the best way to hone my skills is to create a platform to share my work. This website is exactly that, but I don’t want it to serve the sole purpose of showcasing my work, I want it to reflect some of my thinking about the world and represent some part of me as a human being.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that making a personal website is much more effective if it is made with a well-defined purpose. I figure that it would be interesting for the first bonafide post on my, as of yet unfinished, website to outline what I want this website to be. In addition, this post is going to help me style the website in a nice way, my design skills leave much to be desired, and so having a reference will make a world of difference.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-my-website-include">What will my website include?</h2>

<p>I haven’t written down what I want my website to include. A brief spitball of possible elements are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A landing page that has my face, a quick summary of who I am and what I enjoy.</li>
  <li>A blog that will include some projects that I find interesting, to give me a place to practice communicating these projects to other people and incentivise fleshing them out and following through.</li>
  <li>A collection of my writing, should I decide that any of my writing is of sufficient quality to merit being shared.</li>
  <li>A portfolio of the projects that demonstrate my competence. Skills I want to demonstrate competence in include research ability, academic writing, bioinformatics, programming, machine learning etc.</li>
  <li>An About me section/CV - the section that I am most hesitant to write.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, let’s break it down even further, because I certainly want to have each of these elements on my website but simply writing this down does not a good website make.</p>

<h3 class="landing" id="the-landing-page">The Landing Page</h3>

<p><strong>The Intention:</strong> a sleek introduction to my website.</p>

<p>The simplest possible thing to do here is to have my name, a picture of myself (is that even necessary or is it purely self-indulgent?), some quippy non-commital details about myself and maybe some extra flair. This is what people will see first when (if) they come to my website, so it will need to make a statement.</p>

<h3 id="the-blog">The Blog</h3>

<p><strong>The Intention:</strong> documenting my journey of writing code, buiding things, failing often and sometimes succeeding.</p>

<p>Having a blog seems self-explanatory, but I think this intention is the most important one to set clearly for the purposes of <strong>this</strong> post. That’s because I haven’t actually spent any time working on the design of the catalogue <em>or</em> the posts themselves, so this blog post will need to contain the elements that are likely to pop up in the future posts that I make. Right now, the catalogue of posts looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\images\catalogue.png" class="img-fluid" alt="..." /></p>

<p>The posts themselves currently look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="\assets\images\post_layout.png" class="img-fluid" alt="..." /></p>

<p>Immediately, the fact that there is a scrollbar horizontally should jump out at you, this is because I have simply added screenshots, which are large, and there is no image formatting. That’s the kind of problem that I am trying to address. So, I need to work on both the catalogue and the posts themselves, let’s start simple and work our way to the big one.</p>

<h4 id="lists-of-posts">Lists of Posts</h4>

<p>There is a little bit of nice functionality which is hidden beneath the horrendous styling shown above, but I would like to expand. Jekyll has native support for posts, which by using some <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/">liquid</a> can easily generate a list of posts in chronological order. It’s as simple as adding a for loop over each post.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>% for post in site.posts %
  <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"row py-2 px-3"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"col-sm-2"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"col-sm-8 border bg-light rounded"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"datetime align-top"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"post"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">""</span> <span class="na">title=</span><span class="s">""</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;details&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;summary&gt;</span>Read More<span class="nt">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
        
      <span class="nt">&lt;/details&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"col-sm-2"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
% endfor %
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The features that I want to add to the list of posts are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><del>An estimated time to read, which should be quite easy to write a small plugin for.</del></li>
  <li>Tags</li>
  <li>Maybe an optional picture for extra flair</li>
  <li>Expandable abstract/short summary - already implemented but it needs to look nicer.</li>
  <li>A search feature</li>
</ol>

<p>It was quite easy as it turns out to write a small plugin to do read time. I didn’t write the script but there was a custom Ruby gem that did it quite nicely. I found out quickly that github pages, which I use to host this site doesn’t support <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53215356/jekyll-how-to-use-custom-plugins-with-github-pages">custom plugins</a>, although there appears to be a <a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/using-jekyll-plugins/">work-around</a> but I would prefer not to take a tangent.</p>

<p>The solution I ended up using was a slight variation on what I found <a href="https://int3ractive.com/blog/2018/jekyll-read-time-without-plugins/">here</a> from Trần Trọng Thanh. An elegant solution indeed.</p>

<h4 id="post-layout">Post Layout</h4>

<p>The first issue that was addressed, was the fact that there was no formatting of images. This turned out to be an easy fix, although I imagine a more elegant one exists. I simply added HTML tags into the markdown document with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">img-fluid</code> class. Bootstrap handled the rest.</p>

<p>I’ve also discovered that I can add bootstrap classes quite easily because of kramdown, which is the native jekyll markdown <del>interpreter (compiler?)</del> renderer. I’m not sure how I will use this feature right now, but it seems like it will be really helpful to align stuff nicely should the need arise.</p>

<p>Some of the features I want to add are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A table of contents that is sticky to the left hand side of the screen for web-browsers and at the top of the page on mobile?</li>
  <li>An accordion to hide and show code, more technical posts should have code expanded enabled by default whereas less technical posts should have it disabled by default.</li>
  <li>A progress bar, that fills up slowly as the page is read through.</li>
  <li>A version control system, which Jekyll will be able to recognise. If this works you are currently reading version 0.1</li>
</ul>

<p>The blog posts will include a number of elements that I will need to make sure are well formatted. Thinking about this more carefully I will create another blog post that will simply contain all of these different elements so that I can format them correctly. When this is done, you can go <strong>here</strong> to take a look.</p>

<p>In the above screenshot I had included a light-grey border around the element, I have since removed this, as I think that it looks cleaner that way.</p>

<h3 id="my-writing">My Writing</h3>

<p><strong>The Intention:</strong> to have a place to put my writing, bad, good, and everything in between.</p>

<p>Writing is something that I love to do. A lot of the writing that I do doesn’t fit well with my work, and so it would make sense to have a seperate place to put my writing. This section will be very simple, have a list of my writing, without dates or any other flairs.</p>

<p>The material will probably be aligned very simply, no outlines or any extra styling. Just the writing.</p>

<h3 id="my-portfolio">My Portfolio</h3>

<p><strong>The Intention:</strong> a collection of my technical skills.</p>

<p>A collection of my most interesting projects, I really want to put a cool fusion of biotechnology, machine learning, bioinformatics and mathematics here. This will be a showcase of my technical skill.</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p><strong>The Intention:</strong> a voyeuristic insight into the things I care about.</p>
